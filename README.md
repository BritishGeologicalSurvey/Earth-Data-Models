# Earth Data Models
Archive of data models previously published on EarthDataModels.org - a community driven project, providing free and open access to data model designs

Initial suite of data models published on EarthDataModels.org are largely based upon existing relational databases for geological surveys, however, we welcome contributions from all areas of data modelling especially those involved in Geographical Information Systems (GIS), XML or applications development.

## Our Vision...

"Databases are a key element of environmental research. Numerous databases are designed by researchers to hold their data so that they can do their science. The result is that the data of a discipline is locked in numerous, isolated, incompatible databases. The vision of EarthDataModel is that the community will develop a single, integrated environmental data model for all environmental digital data that are appropriate to relational database management technology.

The major business rules will be captured, implemented, validated and fully documented. The emerging community models will have a strong emphasise on the integration of spatial and non-spatial datasets. EarthDataModel is a place where existing designs can be published, shared, reviewed, redesigned and reused until a common community model emerges."
